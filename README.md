# Hospital-Management-System

Implementation with JDBC of a hospital management system.
In this task, I had to deal with the design of a service interface and determine interfaces for new persistent classes.
The persistence of the corresponding interfaces is expressed by the fact that they derive from the interface PersistentObject
To successfully complete the task, the implementation and the developed database accesses is tested with provided JUnit test cases.

The Entityâ€“relationship model can be seen below:
